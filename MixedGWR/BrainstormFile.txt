Working on the function to use as an argument into the (mc)lapply function for the big simulation.
This function has to do (at least) three things:
1) generate data based on the parameters in the expand.grid dataframe
2) run the eight different regression models for all of the different bandwidths
3) collect the output we want to save across replications.
