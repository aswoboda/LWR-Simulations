Working on the function to use as an argument into the (mc)lapply function for the big simulation.
This function has to do (at least) three things:
1) generate data based on the parameters in the expand.grid dataframe
2) run the eight different regression models for all of the different bandwidths
3) collect the output we want to save across replications.

Notes on each task:

1) This step will create a dataset.


2)  This step takes as an input the dataset created in 1).
    Then runs all 8 models (ranging from global OLS to mixed LWR to full LWR)...
    on all bandwidths...
    saving the relevent output needed to calculate the metrics noted in step 3).
