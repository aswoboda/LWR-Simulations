abstract = {We use hedonic analysis of home transaction data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area to estimate the effects of proximity to open space on sales price. We allow the effects of proximity to vary with deomgraphic and location-specific characteristics and include fixed effects to control for observed and unobserved neighborhood characteristics. We find that the value of proximity to open space is higher in neighborhoods that are dense, near the central business district, high-income, high-crime, or home to many children. Using the metropolitan area's average value may substantially overestimate or underestimate the value of open space in particular neighborhoods.},
annote = {RQ: Using home transaction data from the Twin Cities area, what demographic, spatial, and eocnomic factors determine the amenity value of open space in urban housing markets, and how do they vary across neighborhoods?
        
Results: In the Twin Cities area, the effect of open space on housing prices depends on location and neighborhood characteristics. Denser, higher-income neighborhoods "pay" much more for parks than less dense, poorer neighborhoods. Secondly, not controlling for unobserved neighborhood characteristics can lead to biased estimates for observed characteristics.
        
Contribution: This study uses a larger data set of more homes in a larger geographical area, and examines how proximity effects vary with more factors than any other known previous studies. In short, this is a more comprehensive and thorough hedonic analysis than any predecessors known to the authors. },

In the analysis I found considerable evidence that residing at a greater altitude reduces your risk of burglary victimiza- tion, although residing on steeper slopes had no effect. In the discussion I argue that the underlying relief and terrain on which neighborhoods are built should form an essential physical component of the environmental backcloth that surrounds offenders and influences their spatial decision making processes.},

abstract = {Until relatively recently, the emphasis of spatial analysis was on the investigation of global models and global processes. Recent research, however, has tended to explore exceptions to general processes, and techniques have been developed which have as their focus the investigation of spatial variations in local relationships. One of these techniques, known as geographically weighted regression (GWR), developed by the authors is used here to investigate spatial variations in spatial association. The particular framework in which spatial association is examined here is the spatial autoregressive model of Ord, although the technique can easily be applied to any form of spatial autocorrelation measurement. The conceptual and theoretical foundations of GWR applied to the Ord model are followed by an empirical example which uses data on owner-occupation in the housing market of Tyne and Wear in northeast England where the problems of relying on global models of spatial association are demonstrated. This empirical investigation of spatial variations in spatial autocorrelation prompts a further discussion of several issues concerning the statistical technique.},

The nature of the model must alter over space to reflect the structure within the data. In this paper, a technique is developed, termed geographically weighted regression, regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. This technique is loosely based on kernel regression. The method itself is introduced and related issues such as the choice of a spatial weighting function are discussed. Following this, a series of related statistical tests are considered which can be described generally as tests for spatial nonstationarity. Using Monte Carlo methods, techniques are proposed for investigating the null hypothesis that the data may be described by a global model rather than a non-stationary one and also for testing whether individual regression coefficients are stable over geographic space. These techniques are demonstrated on. a data set from the 1991 U.K. census relating car ownership rates to social class and male unemployment. The paper concludes by discussing ways in which the technique can be extended.},

However, the emphasis of much of this work has been exploratory. Despite this, GWR borrows from a well founded statistical methodology (Tibshirani and Hastie 1987; Staniswalis 1987a; Hastie and Tibshirani 1993) and may be used in a more formal modelling context. In particular, one may compare GWR models against other models using modern statistical inferential theories. Here, we demonstatrate how Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike 1973) may be used to decide whether GWR or ordinary regression provide the best model for a given geographical data set. We also demonstrate how the AIC may be used to choose the degree of smoothing used in GWR, and how basic GWR models may be compared to `mixed' models in which some regression coe\#cients are fixed and others are non-stationary.},

Using standard structural measures drawn from an opportunity framework, the study provides results from a global ordinary least squares model, assumed to fit for all locations within the study area. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is then introduced as an alternative to such traditional approaches to modeling crime. The GWR procedure estimates a local model, producing a set of mappable parameter estimates and t-values of significance that vary over space. Several structural measures are found to have relationships with crime that vary significantly with location. Results indicate that a mixed model- with both spatially varying and fixed parameters-may provide the most accurate model of crime. The present study demonstrates the utility of GWR for exploring local processes that drive crime levels and examining misspecification of a global model of urban violence. 10.1177/0894439307298925},

Household-level demographic, health, and water infrastructure data were incorporated into a local geographic information systems (GIS) database. Geographically-weighted regression (GWR) models were constructed to identify spatial variation of relationships across the study area. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression models were run to simultaneously measure the likelihood of increased magnitude of disease events and the likelihood of zero cholera or shigellosis events. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tubewell density on both the occurrence of diarrheal disease and the magnitude of diarrheal disease incidence. Results: In Matlab, households with greater tubewell density were more likely to report zero cholera or shigellosis events. Results for both cholera and shigellosis GWR models suggest that tubewell density effects are spatially stationary and the use of non-spatial statistical methods is appropriate. Conclusions: Increasing the amount of drinking water available to households through increased density of tubewells contributed to lower reports of cholera and shigellosis events in rural Bangladesh. Our findings demonstrate the importance of tubewell installation and access to groundwater in reducing diarrheal disease events in the developing world.},

The findings show that the value of proximity to greenways, parks, and water bodies increased over time, while the value of lot size and proximity to golf cources fell. Proximity to open space is found to be a substitute for lot size, although the degree of substitutionalibility has eakened over time. Geographic variation in the marginal effects of lot size and proximity to open space is analyzed using LWR analysis.},
annote = {RQ: How does lot size and proximity to different kinds of open spaces (golf courses, parks, bodies of water, greenways) effect housing prices in Knox Cty, Tennessee, and does the effect vary both spatially and temporally?
        
Results: Moving 1,000 feet closer to open spaces from the mean distance results in almost universally higher housing prices, usually an increase of between \$165 and \$1,850, but the magnitude of the effect varies both geographically and temporally, depending on the quality of the open space and population density. The results are almost all statistically significant at the 5\% level. A 1000 sq ft increase in lot size from the mean also positively affects housing price by between \$100-\$750, depending on the time period and region. The effect of decreased density decreased over the 2 time periods.
        
Contribution: Cho, et al, uses LWR on data from a single TN county for both spatial and temporal hedonic housing price analysis. The variance in price effects of both lot size and open space proximity captured by the model will be helpful for land use planners, according to the authors. 
        
Data: Pertains to Knox County, TN. Utilized 4 primary GIS data sets: boundary data (Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission), environmental feature data (Knoxville Utilities Board Geographic Informantion System (KGIS)), census-block group data (GeoLytics, a private data provider) , and individual residential data (KGIS and Knox County Tax Assessor's Office). 
Data is for single family homes sold between 1989-1991 and 1999-2001.
        
Methodology/Evidence: First determined via a likelihood ratio (LR) test that the data set should be seperated temporally and regressed seperately as supposed to being pooled. Compared the LWR model results to an OLS regression, found that LWR has higher adj. R-squared values, lower RSS, and F-values that confirm that the local models are a better fit than the global models for both time periods. Also tested for autocorrelation via I-values, and finds that the local model partially but not adequately addresses the AC found in the global models.
        
Future work: Since LWR failed to adequately address spatial autocorrelation in the data, incomplete/misspecification of the model cannot be ruled out, and so further research into spatial dynamics of the housing market is needed.
        
Questions/Comments: In your article, you mention that since LWR smooths parameter changes, it might be inaccurate when dealing with parameter jumps that could occur when moving beweteen neighborhoods. This could also be a concern here, and might have to do with the AC problem?

The first method, Cross Validation (CV), has been commonly used in the applied literature using GWR. A second criterion selected an optimal bandwidth that corresponded with the smallest spatial error Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test statistic. We find that there is a tradeoff between addressing spatial autocorrelation and reducing degree of extreme coefficients in GWR. Although spatial autocorrelation can be controlled for by using the LM criterion, a substantial degree of extreme coefficients may remain. However, while the CV approach appears to be less prone to producing extreme coefficients, it may not always attend to the problems that arise in the presence of spatial error autocorrelation.},

The transit use predictors considered include demographics and socioeconomics, land use, transit supply and quality, and pedestrian environment. The best predictors identified through model estimation include two global variables (regional accessibility of employment and percentage of households with no car) and three local variables (employment density, average number of cars in households with children, and percentage of the population who are black). The models were estimated on the basis of the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package data for Broward County, Florida. Model testing indicates the GWR model has improved accuracy in predicting transit use for HBW purposes over linear regression models. The GWR model also indicates that the effects of the independent variables on transit use vary across space.

Neighborhoods are relevant largely because confidentiality requires spatial aggregation of data collected at the household level. A hedonic model using individual sales transactions and their street addresses is combined with CART (Classification and Regression Trees) to define the optimal number of neighborhoods and to place neighborhood boundaries in one Connecticut town. There are about half the number of CART neighborhoods than there are census tracts. Moreover, the CART boundaries typically run behind the houses rather than down the middle of the street, and they reduce residual variation. The CART model is important to the submarkets literature, which aggregates neighborhoods into larger homogeneous markets. Moreover, anisotropic spatial autocorrelation can be modeled with CART neighborhoods.},

The regression model highlighted the spatial variation of the relationship between the percentage of land afforested and its proximate causes. Factors identified as having a major impact on afforestation are: the presence or proximity of a wood-processing industry, the distance to highways, and land allocation to households. Whereas the two former variables are in most areas of the province positively correlated with afforestation, an unexpected negative correlation was observed for the latter. The analysis of these results, supported by an in-depth knowledge of the area and of the political context, leads to the conclusion that, during the time period considered, afforestation was largely driven by state organisations on protected state-owned land, and forestry was not a significant component of household economic activities.},

The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regeression: (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions: (c) several graphical moethods that are useful tools for understanding loess eestimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based: and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallow's C(p) procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

abstract = {Building on central place theory, we offer a series of simple location models for US credit unions. Credit unions are historically viewed as a community-based strategy designed to fill voids in spatial financial markets. Unlike banks and more traditional retail financial institutions, our results show that credit unions operate in areas with a low concentration of retail banks. This suggests that credit unions do not follow the herd mentality that dominates traditional retail banking institutions. Instead they cluster around common bonds of association. That is credit unions are fundamentally capturing a different market than traditional banks and do not behave in a pro-competitive manner with banks. In the spirit of Bitter et al. (J Geogr Syst 9:727, 2007), we compare the overall performance of geographically weighted regression with a set of both spatial and non-spatial estimators. We find that the spatial estimators generally performed better than the aspatial estimators, and there is significant spatial heterogeneity in some of the determinants of credit union concentrations. Results on individual variables of interest tend to be stable across the different estimators lending confidence to our hypothesis that credit unions serve niche markets.},

abstract = {The paper examines the potential for combining a spatial statistical methodology Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) with geovisual analytical exploration to help understand complex spatio-temporal processes. This is done by applying the combined statistical exploratory methodology to a simulated data set in which the behaviour of regression parameters was controlled across space and time. A variety of complex spatio-temporal processes was captured through space-time (i.e. as spatio-temporal) varying parameters whose values were known. The task was to see if the proposed methodology could uncover these complex processes from the data alone. The results of the experiment confirm that the combined methodology can successfully identify spatio-temporal patterns in the local GWR parameter estimates that correspond to the controlled behaviour of the original parameters.},

@article{Du2006,
abstract = {In recent years, land value capture has attracted increasing attention because of its potential for funding transport infrastructure. It is well acknowledged that transport infrastructure can improve accessibility to employment and amenities; thus one might expect that it is the improved accessibility that adds value to land. Therefore, the issues in the relationship between transport accessibility and land value rise in connection with the concept of land value capture. A study looked at the relationship between transport accessibility and land value with the implication of a local model, geographically weighted regression (GWR). Traditional techniques, such as hedonic models, used to understand the attributes of land value, are global models that could be misleading in examining the spatially varying relationships, such as transport accessibility and land value. By using the Tyne and Wear region in the United Kingdom as a case study, the study revealed that nonstationarity existing in the relationship between transport accessibility and land value indicates that transport accessibility may have a positive effect on land value in some areas but a negative or no effect in others; this suggests that a uniform land value capture would be inappropriate. The use of GWR allows such spatially varying relationships to be revealed, leading to a better understanding of the factors determining positive land value uplift and the implications of spatially dependent transport access premiums in housing values in the context of value capture policies.},

We visually encode information about geographic and statistical proximity and variation in novel ways through gw-choropleth maps, multivariate gw-boxplots, gw-shading and scalograms. The new graphic types reveal information about GW statistics at several scales concurrently. We impement these views in prototype software containing dynamic links and GW interactions that encourage exploration and refine them to consider directional geographies. An informal evaluation uses interactive GW techniques to consider Guerry's dataset of 'moral statistics', casting doubt on correlations originally proposed through visual analysis, revealing new local anomalies and suggesting multivariate geographic relationships. Few attempts at visually synthesising geography with multivariate statistical values at multiple scales have been reported. The geowigs proposed here provide informative representations of multivariate local variation, particularly when combined with interactions that coordinate views and result in gw-shading. We argue that they are widely applicable to area and point-based geographic data and provide a set of methods to support visual analysis using GW statistics through which the effects of geography can be explored at multiple scales.},

We derive equations to estimate the speed of convergence on the basis of an extended Solow model. The technique of geographically weighted regression permits a detailed analysis of convergence processes, which has not been conducted for Germany as yet. It allows the estimation of a separate speed of convergence for every region resulting from the local coefficients of the regression equations. The application of this technique to German labour market regions shows regions moving at different speeds towards their steady states. The half-life periods in the model of conditional convergence disperse less than the same coefficients in the absolute convergence model. Moreover, the speed of convergence is substantially slower in the manufacturing sector than in the service sector.},

abstract = {The regression analyses undertaken commonly in remote sensing are aspatial, ignoring the locational information associated with each sample site at which the variables under study were measured. Typically, basic ordinary least squares regression analysis is used to derive a relationship that is believed to be uniformly applicable across the study area. Although such global analyses may appear satisfactory, often with large coefficients of determination derived, they may provide an inappropriate description of the relationship between the variables under study. In particular, a global regression analysis may miss local detail that can be significant if the relationship is spatially non-stationary. Local statistical approaches, such as geographically weighted regression, include the spatial coordinates of the sample sites in the analysis and may provide a more appropriate basis for the investigation of the relationship between variables. The potential value of geographically weighted regression to the remote sensing community is illustrated with reference to the relationship between the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and rainfall over north Africa and the Middle East over an 8-year period. For each year, spatial non-stationarity was evident, particularly with regard to the slope parameter of the regression model. Moreover, the conventional ordinary least squares regression models, while superficially strong (minimum R2=0.67), were relatively poor local descriptors of the relationship. Relative to this, the geographically weighted approach to regression provided considerably stronger relationships from the same data sets (minimum R2=0.96) as well as highlighting areas of local variation. The implications of the difference in the outputs from the two types of regression analysis are illustrated with reference to the use of the derived NDVIrainfall relationships in mapping desert extent. For example, with the data relating to 1987 the southern limit of the Sahara was generally estimated to lie at a more southerly position when the relationship derived from OLS rather than geographically weighted regression was used.},

abstract = {Landscape fragmentation is usually caused by many different anthropogenic influences and landscape elements. Scientifically revealing the spatial relationships between landscape fragmentation and related factors is highly significant for land management and urban planning. The former studies on statistical relationships between landscape fragmentation and related factors were almost global and single-scaled. In fact, landscape fragmentations and their causal factors are usually location-dependent and scale-dependent. Therefore, we used geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), with a case study in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China, to examine spatially varying and scale-dependent relationships between effective mesh size, an indicator of landscape fragmentation, and related factors. We employed the distance to main roads as a direct influencing factor, and slope and the distance to district centers as indirect influencing factors, which affect landscape fragmentation through their impacts on land use and urbanization, respectively. The results show that these relationships are spatially non-stationary and scale-dependent, indicated by clear spatial patterns of parameter estimates obtained from GWR models, and the curves with a characteristic scale of 12km for three explanatory variables, respectively. Moreover, GWR models have better model performance than OLS models with the same independent variable, as is indicated by lower AICc values, higher Adjusted R2 values from GWR and the reduction of the spatial autocorrelation of residuals. GWR models can reveal detailed site information on the different roles of related factors in different parts of the study area. Therefore, this finding can provide a scientific basis for policy-making to mitigate the negative effects of landscape fragmentation.},

Extending the Capozza and Helsey model (1989) to the case of uncertainty in future land use zoning, a spatialized hedonic model is proposed to estimate such anticipation phenomena at a fine level (cadastral unit). Estimations use Mixed Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) techniques with a two-stage model that links agricultural and developable land markets. This allows for mapping varying spatial parameters that measure anticipation effects within the theoretical framework. Results confirm the influence of anticipation on agricultural land prices in the Provence region. Moreover, the level of data spatialization allows us to take into account intra-municipalities' heterogeneity of land use conversion anticipation.},

abstract = {Previous quantitative research on environmental justice has been limited by simplistic assumptions used to measure health risks and traditional regression techniques that fail to discern spatial variations in statistical relationships. We address these gaps through a case study that examines: (a) whether potential health risks from exposure to hazardous air pollutants in Florida are related to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and (b) how the significance of statistical associations between health risk and race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status vary across the state. This study integrates census tract level estimates of cumulative cancer risk compiled by the EPA with Census 2000 data and a spatial statistical technique known as geographically weighted regression that allows us to explore spatial variability in analytical results. Our findings indicate that while race and ethnicity are significantly related to cancer risks in Florida, conventional regression can hide important local variations in statistical relationships relevant to environmental justice analysis.},

abstract = {The analysis of health data and putative covariates, such as environmental, socio-economic, behavioral or demographic factors, is a promising application for geostatistics. It presents, however, several methodological challenges that arise from the fact that data are typically aggregated over irregular spatial supports and consist of a numerator and a denominator (i.e. population size). This paper presents an overview of recent developments in the ﬁeld of health geostatistics, with an emphasis on three main steps in the analysis of aggregated health data: estimation of the underlying disease risk, detection of areas with signiﬁcantly higher risk, and analysis of relationships with putative risk factors. The analysis is illustrated using age-adjusted cervix cancer mortality rates recorded over the 19701994 period for 118 counties of four states in the Western USA. Poisson kriging allows the ﬁltering of noisy mortality rates computed from small population sizes, enhancing the correlation with two putative explanatory variables: percentage of habitants living below the federally deﬁned poverty line, and percentage of Hispanic females. Areato-point kriging formulation creates continuous maps of mortality risk, reducing the visual bias associated with the interpretation of choropleth maps. Stochastic simulation is used to generate realizations of cancer mortality maps, which allows one to quantify numerically how the uncertainty about the spatial distribution of health outcomes translates into uncertainty about the location of clusters of high values or the correlation with covariates. Last, geographically-weighted regression highlights the non-stationarity in the explanatory power of covariates: the higher mortality values along the coast are better explained by the two covariates than the lower risk recorded in Utah},

The market is a new one, having only been fully established in 1998. The analysis in the paper is in the form of an aggregate (county-level) hedonic model specified in two versions. Global parameters results are estimated using spatial error model specifications while more local effects are estimated by geographically weighted regression. Global results are typical in that structural characteristics such as floor space and contextual characteristics such as level of in-migration are important in residential prices. Local results, however, indicate significant spatial variation in the effect of both structural amenities and locational context on housing prices. In a simpler specification, rents are shown to respond positively to both median house prices levels and the supply of apartments available at market prices, but also with significant spatial variation across China.},

abstract = {Increasingly, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is being used for spatial prediction rather than for inference. Our study compares GWR as a predictor to (a) its global counterpart of multiple linear regression (MLR); (b) traditional geostatistical models such as ordinary kriging (OK) and universal kriging (UK), with MLR as a mean component; and (c) hybrids, where kriging models are specified with GWR as a mean component. For this purpose, we test the performance of each model on data simulated with differing levels of spatial heterogeneity (with respect to data relationships in the mean process) and spatial autocorrelation (in the residual process). Our results demonstrate that kriging (in a UK form) should be the preferred predictor, reflecting its optimal statistical properties. However the GWR-kriging hybrids perform with merit and, as such, a predictor of this form may provide a worthy alternative to UK for particular (non-stationary relationship) situations when UK models cannot be reliably calibrated. GWR predictors tend to perform more poorly than their more complex GWR-kriging counterparts, but both GWR-based models are useful in that they provide extra information on the spatial processes generating the data that are being predicted.},

abstract = {In this study, we link and compare the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model with the kriging with an external drift (KED) model of geostatistics. This includes empirical work where models are performance tested with respect to prediction and prediction uncertainty accuracy. In basic forms, GWR and KED (specified with local neighbourhoods) both cater for nonstationary correlations (i.e. the process is heteroskedastic with respect to relationships between the variable of interest and its covariates) and as such, can predict more accurately than models that do not. Furthermore, on specification of an additional heteroskedastic term to the same models (now with respect to a process variance), locally-accurate measures of prediction uncertainty can result. These heteroskedastic extensions of GWR and KED can be preferred to basic constructions, whose measures of prediction uncertainty are only ever likely to be globally-accurate. We evaluate both basic and heteroskedastic GWR and KED models using a case study data set, where data relationships are known to vary across space. Here GWR performs well with respect to the more involved KED model and as such, GWR is considered a viable alternative to the more established model in this particular comparison. Our study adds to a growing body of empirical evidence that GWR can be a worthy predictor; complementing its more usual guise as an exploratory technique for investigating relationships in multivariate spatial data sets.},

Although this analysis is important in developing a greater understanding of the critical load process, the study also examines the application of the GWR technique itself. In particular, and unlike many previous presentations of GWR, the steps taken in choosing a particular GWR model form are presented in detail. A further important advance here is that the calibration results of the chosen GWR model are scrutinized for robustness to outlying observations. With respect to the critical load process itself, the results of this study largely agree with those of earlier research, where relationships between critical load and catchment data can vary across space. The more sophisticated spatial statistical models used here, however, are shown to be more flexible and informative, allowing a clearer picture of process heterogeneities to be revealed.},

abstract = {This article presents a data-driven framework for housing market segmentation. Local marginal house price surfaces are investigated by means of mixed geographically weighted regression and are reduced to a set of principal component maps, which in turn serve as input for spatial regionalization. The out-of-sample prediction error of a hedonic pricing model is applied to determine a near-optimal number of spatially coherent and homogeneous submarkets. The usefulness of this method is demonstrated with a detailed data set for the Austrian housing market. The results provide evidence that submarkets must always be considered, however they are defined, and that the proposed submarket taxonomy on a regional level significantly improves predictive quality compared to (1) a traditional pooled model, (2) a model that uses an ad hoc submarket definition based on administrative units, and (3) a model incorporating an alternative submarket definition on the basis of aspatial k-means clustering. Moreover, it is concluded that the Austrian housing market is characterized by regional determinants and that geography is the most important component determining the house prices.},

This article examines the driving forces that cause urban-to-rural migration of population in the Austrian metropolitan area of Vienna using exploratory spatial analysis methods over the time period from 2001 to 2006. To model the qualitative changes between sub- and postsuburban processes, fuzzy sets are applied as variables. Because of significant concentration of high urban-to-rural migration along the main transportation corridors, a geographically weighted regression approach is used to determine whether suburban or postsuburban determinants are essential to predict urban-to-rural migration. The results show that the spatial variation of urban-to-rural migration can be statistically best modeled by using the two covariates good accessibility to the core city by motorized individual transport and a high land price index. The article argues that this represents the prominence of classical hard location factors, which are interpreted as typical suburban. Accordingly, the metropolitan area isconcerning urban-to-rural migrationstill under the influence of suburban processes.},

abstract = {By incorporating temporal effects into the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, an extended GWR model, geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR), has been developed to deal with both spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously in real estate market data. Unlike the standard GWR model, GTWR integrates both temporal and spatial information in the weighting matrices to capture spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The GTWR design embodies a local weighting scheme wherein GWR and temporally weighted regression (TWR) become special cases of GTWR. In order to test its improved performance, GTWR was compared with global ordinary least squares, TWR, and GWR in terms of goodness-of-fit and other statistical measures using a case study of residential housing sales in the city of Calgary, Canada, from 2002 to 2004. The results showed that there were substantial benefits in modeling both spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously. In the test sample, the TWR, GWR, and GTWR models, respectively, reduced absolute errors by 3.5\%, 31.5\%, and 46.4\% relative to a global ordinary least squares model. More impressively, the GTWR model demonstrated a better goodness-of-fit (0.9282) than the TWR model (0.7794) and the GWR model (0.8897). McNamara's test supported the hypothesis that the improvements made by GTWR over the TWR and GWR models are statistically significant for the sample data.},

It thus does not present a viable alternative to the spatial methods. Similar to existing comparisons between results from non-spatial and established spatial methods, we also find that OLS generates higher coefficient and direct effect estimates for both structural and locational housing characteristics than spatial methods do. OLS with spatial fixed effects is closer to the spatial estimates than OLS without fixed effects but remains higher. Finally, a comparison of the direct effects with locally weighted regression results highlights spatial threshold effects that are missed in the global models. Differences between spatial estimators are almost negligible in this study.},

abstract = {This paper describes the results of a geo-statistical analysis carried out at the provincial level in Southern Europe to model wildfire occurrence from socio-economic and demographic indicators together with land cover and agricultural statistics. We applied a classical ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression together with a geographically weighted regression (GWR) to explain long-term wildfire occurrence patterns (mean annual density of >1 ha fires). The explanatory power of the OLS model increased from 52\% to 78\% as a result of the non-constant relationships between fire occurrence and the underlying explanatory variables throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The global model we developed (i.e., OLS regression) was not sufficient to fully describe the underlying causal factors in wildfire occurrence modeling. Indeed, local approaches (i.e., GWR) can complement the global model in overcoming the problem of non-stationarity or missing variables. Our results confirm the importance of agrarian activities, land abandonment, and development processes as underlying factors of fire occurrence. The identification of regions with spatially varying relationships can contribute to the better understanding of the fire problem, especially over large geographic areas, while at the same time recognizing its local character. This can be very important for fire management and policy.},

abstract = {This text provides an introduction to spatial econometric theory along with numerous applied illustrations of the models and methods described. The applications utilize a set of MATLAB functions that implement a host of spatial econometric estimation methods. The intended audience is faculty,studen ts and practitioners involved in modeling spatial data sets. The MATLAB functions described in this book have been used in my own research as well as teaching both undergraduate and graduate econometrics courses. They are available on the Internet at http://www.econ.utoledo.edu along with the data sets and examples from the text. The theory and applied illustrations of conventional spatial econometric models represent about half of the content in this text,with the other half devoted to Bayesian alternatives. Conventional maximum likelihood estimation for a class of spatial econometric models is discussed in one chapter,follo wed by a chapter that introduces a Bayesian approach for this same set of models. It is well-known that Bayesian methods implemented with a diffuse prior simply reproduce maximum likelihood results,and we illustrate this point. However, the main motivation for introducing Bayesian methods is to extend the conventional models. Comparative illustrations demonstrate how Bayesian methods can solve problems that confront the conventional models. Recent advances in Bayesian estimation that rely on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods make it easy to estimate these models. This approach to estimation has been implemented in the spatial econometric function library described in the text, so estimation using the Bayesian models require a single additional line in your computer program. Some of the Bayesian methods have been introduced in the regional science literature,or presented at conferences. Space and time constraints prohibit any discussion of implementation details in these forums. This text describes the implementation details,whic h I believe greatly enhance understanding and allow users to make intelligent use of these methods in applied settings. Audiences have been amazed (and perhaps skeptical) when I tell them it takes only 10 seconds to generate a sample of 1,000 MCMC draws from a sequence of conditional distributions needed to estimate the Bayesian models. Implementation approaches that achieve this type of speed are described here in the hope that other researchers can apply these ideas in their own work. I have often been asked about Monte Carlo evidence for Bayesian spatial econometric methods. Large and small sample properties of estimation procedures are frequentist notions that make no sense in a Bayesian setting. The best support for the efficacy of Bayesian methods is their ability to provide solutions to applied problems. Hopefully,the ease of using these methods will encourage readers to experiment with these methods and compare the Bayesian results to those from more conventional estimation methods. Implementation details are also provided for maximum likelihood methods that draw on the sparse matrix functionality of MATLAB and produce rapid solutions to large applied problems with a minimum of computer memory. I believe the MATLAB functions for maximum likelihood estimation of conventional models presented here represent fast and efficient routines that are easier to use than any available alternatives. Talking to colleagues at conferences has convinced me that a simple software interface is needed so practitioners can estimate and compare a host of alternative spatial econometric model specifications. An example in Chapter 5 produces estimates for ten different spatial autoregressive models,including maximum likelihood,robust Bayesian,and a robust Bayesian tobit model. Estimation, prin ting and plotting of results for all these models is accomplished with a 39 line program. Many researchers ignore sample truncation or limited dependent variables because they face problems adapting existing spatial econometric software to these types of sample data. This text describes the theory behind robust Bayesian logit/probit and tobit versions of spatial autoregressive models and geographically weighted regression models. It also provides implementation details and software functions to estimate these models. Toolboxes are the name given by the MathWorks to related sets of MATLAB functions aimed at solving a particular class of problems. Toolboxes of functions useful in signal and a host of other areas are available from the MathWorks as add-ons to the standard MATLAB software distribution. I use the term Econometrics Toolbox to refer to my public domain collection of function libraries available at the internet address given above. The MATLAB spatial econometrics functions used to implement the spatial econometric models discussed in this text rely on many of the functions in the Econometrics Toolbox. The spatial econometric functions constitute a library within the broader set of econometric functions. To use the spatial econometrics function library you need to download and install the entire set of Econometrics Toolbox functions. The spatial econometrics function library is part of the Econometrics Toolbox and will be available for use along with more traditional econometrics functions. The collection of around 500 econometrics functions and demonstration programs are organized into libraries, with approximately 40 spatial econometrics library functions described in this text. A manual is available for the Econometrics Toolbox in Acrobat PDF and postscript on the internet site,but this text should provide all the information needed to use the spatial econometrics library. A consistent design was implemented that provides documentation,example programs,and functions to produce printed as well as graphical presentation of estimation results for all of the econometric and spatial econometric functions. This was accomplished using the structure variables introduced in MATLAB Version 5. Information from estimation procedures is encapsulated into a single variable that contains fields for individual parameters and statistics related to the econometric results. A thoughtful design by the MathWorks allows these structure variables to contain scalar,v ector,matrix,string,and even multidimensional matrices as fields. This allows the econometric functions to return a single structure that contains all estimation results. These structures can be passed to other functions that intelligently decipher the information and provide a printed or graphical presentation of the results. The Econometrics Toolbox along with the spatial econometrics library functions should allow faculty to use MATLAB in undergraduate and graduate level courses with absolutely no programming on the part of students or faculty. Practitioners should be able to apply the methods described in this text to problems involving large spatial data samples using an input program with less than 50 lines. Researchers should be able to modify or extend the existing functions in the spatial econometrics library. They can also draw on the utility routines and other econometric functions in the Econometrics Toolbox to implement and test new spatial econometric approaches. I have returned from conferences and implemented methods from papers that were presented in an hour or two by drawing on the resources of the Econometrics Toolbox. This text has another goal,applied modeling strategies and data analysis. Given the ability to easily implement a host of alternative models and produce estimates rapidly,atten tion naturally turns to which models best summarize a particular spatial data sample. Much of the discussion in this text involves these issues. My experience has been that researchers tend to specialize,one group is devoted to developing new econometric procedures,and another group focuses on applied problems that involve using existing methods. This text should have something to offer both groups. If those developing new spatial econometric procedures are serious about their methods,they should take the time to craft a generally useful MATLAB function that others can use in applied research. The spatial econometrics function library provides an illustration of this approach and can be easily extended to include new functions. It would also be helpful if users who produce generally useful functions that extend the spatial econometrics library would submit them for inclusion. This would have the added benefit of introducing these new research methods to faculty and their students. There are obviously omissions,bugs and perhaps programming errors in the Econometrics Toolbox and the spatial econometrics library functions. This would likely be the case with any such endeavor. I would be grateful if users would notify me via e-mail at they encounter problems. The toolbox is constantly undergoing revision and new functions are being added. If youre using these functions,up date to the latest version every few months and youll enjoy speed improvements along with the benefits of new methods. Instructions for downloading and installing these functions are in an Appendix to this text along with a listing of the functions in the library and a brief description of each. Numerous people have helped in my spatial econometric research efforts and the production of this text. John Geweke explained the mysteries of MCMC estimation when I was a visiting scholar at the Minneapolis FED. He shared his FORTRAN code and examples without which MCMC estimation might still be a mystery. Luc Anselin with his encylopedic knowledge of the field was kind enough to point out errors in my early work on MCMC estimation of the Bayesian models and set me on the right track. He has always been encouraging and quick to point out that he explored Bayesian spatial econometric m},

abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a useful technique for exploring spatial nonstationarity by calibrating, for example, a regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. In this line of research, many spatial data sets have been successfully analyzed and some statistical tests for spatial variation have been developed. However, an important assumption in these studies is that the disturbance terms of the GWR model are uncorrelated and of common variance. Similar to the case in the ordinary linear regression, spatial autocorrelation can invalidate the standard assumption of homoscedasticity of the disturbances and mislead the results of statistical inference. Therefore, developing some statistical methods to test for spatial autocorrelation is a very important issue. In this paper, two kinds of the statistical tests for spatial autocorrelation among the residuals of the GWR model are suggested. Also, an efficient approximation method for calculating the p-values of the test statistics is proposed. Some simulations are run to examine the performances of the proposed methods and the results are encouraging. The study not only makes it possible to test for spatial autocorrelation among the GWR residuals in a conventional statistical manner, but also provides a useful means for model validation.},

The work makes it possible to test spatial nonstationarity in a conventional statistical manner. To substantiate the theoretical arguments, some simulations are run to examine the power of the statistics for exploring spatial nonstationarity and the results are encouraging. To streamline the model, a stepwise procedure for choosing important independent variables is also formulated. In the last section, a prediction problem based on the GWR model is studied, and a confidence interval for the true value of the dependent variable at a new location is also established.

Demographic survey data from rural South Africa, combined with indicators of natural resource availability from satellite imagery, are employed in a nested modeling approach that brings out distinct patterns of spatial variation in model associations derived at finer geographic scales. Given recent heightened public and policy concern with the human migratory implications of climate change, we argue that consideration of spatial variability adds important nuance to scientific understanding of the migration-environment association.},

Most research in this field discusses the dengue-mosquito or dengue-human relationships over a particular study area, but few have explored the local spatial variations of dengue-mosquito and dengue-human relationships within a study area. This study examined whether spatial heterogeneity exists in these relationships. We used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models to analyze spatial relationships and identify the geographical heterogeneities by using the information of entomology and dengue cases in the cities of Kaohsiung and Fengshan in 2002. Our findings indicate that dengue-mosquito and dengue-human relationships were significantly spatially non-stationary. This means that in some areas higher dengue incidences were associated with higher vector/host densities, but in some areas higher incidences were related to lower vector/host densities. We demonstrated that a GWR model can be used to geographically differentiate the relationships of dengue incidence with immature mosquito and human densities. This study provides more insights into spatial targeting of intervention and control programs against dengue outbreaks within the study areas.},

abstract = {Areal interpolation is used to transfer attribute information from the initial set of source units with known values to the target units with unknown values before subsequent spatial analysis can occur. The areal units with unknown attribute information can be either at a finer scale or misaligned with respect to the source data layer. This article presents and describes a geographically weighted regression (GWR) method for solving areal interpolation problems for nested areal units and misaligned areal units. Population data, selected as the attribute information, are interpolated from census tracts to block groups (a finer scale) and pseudo-tracts (misaligned from tracts but at the same approximate scale). Root mean square error, adjusted root mean square error, and mean absolute error are calculated to evaluate the performance of the interpolation methods. The land cover data derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper Satellite Imagery with a 30?30 m spatial resolution are applied to as the ancillary data to describe the underlying distribution of population. To evaluate the utility of GWR as an areal interpolation method, the simple areal weighting method, a dasymetric method, and different ordinary least squares regression methods are used in this article as comparison methods. Results suggest that GWR is a better interpolator for the misaligned data problem than for the finer scale data problem. The latter is a result of issues associated with the scaling step to ensure the pycnophylatic property required in areal interpolation.},

abstract = {Information on how populations are spatially concentrated by different characteristics is a key means of guiding government policies in a variety of contexts, in addition to being of substantial academic interest. In particular, to reduce inequalities between groups, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of these groups in terms of their composition and their geographical structure. This article explores the degree to which the population of Northern Ireland is spatially concentrated by a range of characteristics. There is a long history of interest in residential segregation by religion in Northern Ireland; this article assesses population concentration not only by community background (religion or religion brought up in) but also by housing tenure, employment and other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. The spatial structure of geographical variables can be captured by a range of spatial statistics including Moran's I. Such approaches utilise information on connections between observations or the distances between them. While such approaches are conceptually an improvement on standard aspatial statistics, a logical further step is to compute statistics on a local basis on the grounds that most real-world properties are not spatially homogenous and, therefore, global measures may mask much variation. In population geography, which provides the substantive focus for this article, there are still relatively few studies that assess in depth the application of geographically weighted statistics for exploring population characteristics individually and for exploring relations between variables. This article demonstrates the value of such approaches by using a variety of geographically weighted statistical measures to explore outputs from the 2001 Census of Population of Northern Ireland. A key objective is to assess the degree to which the population is spatially divided, as judged by the selected variables. In other words, do people cluster more strongly with others who share their community background or others who have a similar socioeconomic status in some respect? The analysis demonstrates how geographically weighted statistics can be used to explore the degree to which single socioeconomic and demographic variables and relations between such variables differ at different spatial scales and at different geographical locations. For example, the results show that there are regions comprising neighbouring areas with large proportions of people from the same community background, but with variable unemployment levels, while in other areas the first case holds true but unemployment levels are consistently low. The analysis supports the contention that geographical variations in population characteristics are the norm, and these cannot be captured without using local methods. An additional methodological contribution relates to the treatment of counts expressed as percentages.},

abstract = {The analysis of quantitative sources of data on multiple population characteristics is often conducted through the use of some form of multivariate statistical procedure such as principal components analysis (PCA). Such approaches assist in the identification of characteristics that group different populations or that vary between these groups. This paper focuses on two particular problems that are rarely considered in the analysis of multivariate population data. Firstly, it makes use of methods for dealing properly with compositional data (i.e., sets of values that sum to a constant such as 1 (proportions) or 100 (percentages)). Secondly, it uses a geographically weighted variant of PCA (GWPCA) (in addition to standard PCA) to explore variations in the characteristics in the population across the study area. In cases where data are spatially-referenced (and are therefore mappable), standard PCA, like any global summary, captures general trends but may mask marked local variations. GWPCA allows assessment of the representivity of standard PCA by providing locally-derived sets of principal components at all data locations. The methods are illustrated through a case study with focuses on selected characteristics of the population of Northern Ireland as represented in data released from the 2001 Census of Population. Key substantive findings include that the characteristics which most strongly differentiate members of the population are geographically variable.},

abstract = {Environmental noise has become a major issue in densely urbanized areas. The impact of this externality on the quality of life is reflected by a decrease in the residents' well-being, and subsequently a decrease in property values. A considerable number of studies have used hedonic pricing (HP) to assess the impact of noise on property markets, but few of them have considered the existence of submarkets. Theoretically, it could be expected that the marginal value of 1 dB varies according to the neighbourhood's noise exposure, the property characteristics (e.g., insulation level) and the annoyance experienced by residents. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether noise has a stationary impact on property prices. Geographically weighted regression is used, which resolves spatial dependencies (i.e., spatial autocorrelation) and considers "soft borders" between submarkets to study the impact of noise on the value of a sample of multifamily dwellings in Barcelona. The analysis suggests that the noise level does matter, although the noise depreciation sensitivity index (NDSI) found (0.08 per cent) is in the bottom decile of the HP studies reviewed by Navrud. However, the NDSI is not stationary throughout the city, suggesting that 1 dB has a different impact in different areas.},

abstract = {Background: Proximity to parks and physical activity sites has been linked to an increase in active behaviors, and positive impacts on health outcomes such as lower rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Since populations with a low socio-economic status as well as racial and ethnic minorities tend to experience worse health outcomes in the USA, access to parks and physical activity sites may be an environmental justice issue. Geographic Information systems were used to conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses of park accessibility in New York City, which included kernel density estimation, ordinary least squares (global) regression, geographically weighted (local) regression, and longitudinal case studies, consisting of field work and archival research. Accessibility was measured by both density of park acreage and density of physical activity sites. Independent variables included percent non-Hispanic black, percent Hispanic, percent below poverty, percent of adults without high school diploma, percent with limited English-speaking ability, and population density. Results: The ordinary least squares linear regression found weak relationships in both the park acreage density and the physical activity site density models (Ra 2 = .11 and .23, respectively; AIC = 7162 and 3529, respectively). Geographically weighted regression, however, suggested spatial non-stationarity in both models, indicating disparities in accessibility that vary over space with respect to magnitude and directionality of the relationships (AIC = 2014 and -1241, respectively). The qualitative analysis supported the findings of the local regression, confirming that although there is a geographically inequitable distribution of park space and physical activity sites, it is not globally predicted by race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status. Conclusion: The combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated the complexity of the issues around racial and ethnic disparities in park access. They revealed trends that may not have been otherwise detectable, such as the spatially inconsistent relationship between physical activity site density and socio-demographics. In order to establish a more stable global model, a number of additional factors, variables, and methods might be used to quantify park accessibility, such as network analysis of proximity, perception of accessibility and usability, and additional park quality characteristics. Accurate measurement of park accessibility can therefore be important in showing the links between opportunities for active behavior and beneficial health outcomes.},

GWR is a useful exploratory analytical tool that generates a set of location-specific parameter estimates which can be mapped and analysed to provide information on spatial nonstationarity in relationships between predictors and the outcome variable. A major challenge to GWR users, however, is how best to map these parameter estimates. This paper introduces a simple mapping technique that combines local parameter estimates and local t-values on one map.

abstract = {In contrast to the rigid structure of standard parametric hedonic analysis, nonparametric estimators control for misspecified spatial effects while using highly flexible functional forms. Despite these advantages, nonparametric procedures are still not used extensively for spatial data analysis due to perceived difficulties associated with estimation and hypothesis testing. We demonstrate that nonparametric estimation is feasible for large datasets with many independent variables, offering statistical tests of individual covariates and tests of model specification. We show that fixed parameterization of distance to the nearest rapid transit line is a misspecification and that pricing of access to this amenity varies across neighborhoods within Chicago.},
annote = {RQ: Is the use of LWR in an hedonic analysis of spatial data feasible, and does it accurately describe hedonic house price function compared to fixed parametric spatial models in the context of Monte Carlo procedure and Chicago housing price hedonic analysis?
        
Results: The Monte Carlo procedure shows that LWR conserves on DoF and achieves a high level of predictive accuracy compared to fully nonparametric estimation. The hedonic analysis yields geographically varying estimates of the price of EL access, suggesting that fixed parameter estimates are less accurate/misspecified
        
Contribution: Redfearn and McMillen demonstrate the usefulness of LWR through a Monte Carlo procedure, and show that fixed parameter hedonic estimates of EL accessability mask geographical variance, which a LWR picks up on. 
        
Data: Generated data sets in order to perform Monte Carlo procedure, one with a continuously declining dependent variable with distance from the city center and one with irregular "neighborhoods" that introduce shifts in the values.
For the hedonic estimate, a data set of 3,705 observations of Chicago single-family home sales in 2000 within 1 mile of Chicago's elevated train (EL) was used. Assessor's data was used to obtain standard housing characteristics like lot size, \# of rooms, etc. 
        
Methodology: The Monte Carlo procedure was performed with a smoothly changing spatial dependent variable and one with shifts, representing neighborhoods. A third procedure was performed with proxied fixed effects and slope interactions, to introduce some error/uncertainty and more accurately reflect the real world, where researchers will not have perfect knowledge of neighborhood boundaries. 
In the hedonic estimate of the component of EL proximity as in single-family housing prices, the authors first performed a global OWL linear regression that, in its final form, resulted in statistically insignificant results for distance from El stop, thanks to the geographic noise from the data. LWR was then used, both with a 25\% window size and a 100\% window size, with both nonparametric and semi-parametric estimates. 
        
Evidence: The authors state that a large window needs to be used for locational variables, like distance to nearest EL stop, in order to measure the marginal effects, and with a window size of 100\%, find that prices decline by almost 17\% per additional mile from the nearest EL stop. For a 25\% window, the spatial pattern of the coefficients shows information that a simple OLS would simply mask because of data aggregation. The authors provide additional evidence for the strength of LWR by withholding 400 random observations from their data set and using the rest of data set to "predict" the holdouts. RSME for the LWR was much lower than the OLS, and while OLS with census tract fixed effects had a slightly lower RSME than LWR, LWR used only 1/3 the degrees of freedom. 
        
Future Work: While the authors seek to introduce LWR as a new and powerful tool, it is not the single "best" approach, and thus there might be other ways that provide accurate alternatives that should be examined.

Undoubtedly, how to identify these two types of the explanatory variables is essential for building such a model. Nevertheless, It seems that there has not been a formal way to achieve this task. Based on some work on the GWR technique and the distribution theory of quadratic forms in normal variables, a statistical test approach is suggested here to identify a mixed GWR model. Then, this note mainly focuses on simulation studies to examine the performance of the test and to provide some guidelines for performing the test in practice. The simulation studies demonstrate that the test works quite well and provides a feasible way to choose an appropriate mixed GWR model for a given data set.},

abstract = {A mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model is a kind of regression model in which some coefficients of the explanatory variables are constant, but others vary spatially. It is a useful statistical modelling tool in a number of areas of spatial data analysis. After an MGWR model is identified and calibrated, which has been well studied recently, one of the important inference problems is to evaluate the influence of the explanatory variables in the constant-coefficient part on the response of the model. This is useful in the selection of the variables and for the purpose of explanation. In this paper, a statistical inference framework for this issue is suggested and, besides the F-approximation, which has been frequently used in the literature of the geographically weighted regression technique, a bootstrap procedure for deriving the p-value of the test is also suggested. The performance of the test is investigated by extensive simulations. It is demonstrated that both the F-approximation and the bootstrap procedure work satisfactorily.},

abstract = {This paper describes geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) and its semi-parametric variant as a new statistical tool for analysing disease maps arising from spatially non-stationary processes. The method is a type of conditional kernel regression which uses a spatial weighting function to estimate spatial variations in Poisson regression parameters. It enables us to draw surfaces of local parameter estimates which depict spatial variations in the relationships between disease rates and socio-economic characteristics. The method therefore can be used to test the general assumption made, often without question, in the global modelling of spatial data that the processes being modelled are stationary over space. Equally, it can be used to identify parts of the study region in which 'interesting' relationships might be occurring and where further investigation might be warranted. Such exceptions can easily be missed in traditional global modelling and therefore GWPR provides disease analysts with an important new set of statistical tools. We demonstrate the GWPR approach applied to a data set of working-age deaths in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. The results indicate that there are significant spatial variations (that is, variation beyond that expected from random sampling) in the relationships between working-age mortality and occupational segregation and between working-age mortality and unemployment throughout the Tokyo metropolitan area and that, consequently, the application of traditional 'global' models would yield misleading results.},

By synthesizing ideas from contemporary understandings of life-course influences on migration and earlier work on income migration, the paper builds a theoretical model of factors shaping income migration across space and tests the model with evidence from Census 2000 by using both ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression techniques. The analysis highlights the importance of life-course understandings of migration in shaping nonearnings income flows across space. Demographic factors such as concentrations of married couples with no children combine with quality-of-life and economic variables to explain nonearnings income migration. Other factors such as housing-market costs and immigration rates shape nonearnings income flows more powerfully in certain regions than in others. The results have important policy implications. With the baby boomers on the cusp of retirement, an understanding of the geographies of nonearnings income will be important for future regional economic planning and forecasting, as these income sources will become increasingly large components of total personal income.},

The purpose of this research is to test for and explore spatial variation in the relationship between socio-economic and green vegetation land cover across urban, suburban, and rural areas, using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The analysis was conducted at the census block group level for Massachusetts, using Census 2000 data and impervious surface data at 1-m resolution. To explore regional variations in the relationship, four scenarios were generated by regressing each of the following socio-economic variables - median household income, percentage of poverty, percentage of minority population, and median home value - against two environmental variables - percent of impervious surface and population density GWR results show that there is a considerable spatial variation in the character and the strength of the relationship for each model. There are two main conclusions in this study. First, the impervious surface is generally a strong predictor of the level of wealth as measured by four variables included in the analysis, at the scale of census block group; however, the strength of the relationship varies geographically. Second. GWR, not ordinary least squares technique, should be used for regional scale spatial analysis because it is able to account for local effects and shows geographical variation in the strength of the relationship.

This article compares a selection of techniques to assess their performance. The focus is on moving window approaches that can be conceptualised as sliding neighbourhoods (i.e. soft market segmentations) and that can incorporate spatial dependency effects. Comparison of moving windows regression (MWR), geographically weighted regression (GWR) and moving windows Kriging (MWK) sheds light on the relevance of different spatial effects. Results using Toronto as a case study indicate that market segmentation may be more important than spatial dependencies. The findings suggest practical guidelines with regard to the use of the models investigated.},

In a local modeling framework, however, the issue of how to detect and model spatial association by using geographically weighted regression (GWR) remains largely unresolved. In this paper we exploit a recent development that casts GWR as a model of locational heterogeneity, to formulate a general model of spatial effects that includes as special cases GWR with a spatially lagged objective variable and GWR with spatial error autocorrelation. The approach also permits the derivation of formal tests against several forms of model misspecification, including locational heterogeneity in global models, and spatial error autocorrelation in GWR models. Application of these results is exemplified with a case study.},

abstract = {Most standard methods of statistical analysis used in the social and environmental sciences are built upon the basic assumptions of independence, homogeneity, and isotropy. A notable exception to this rule is the collection of methods used in geographical analysis, which have been designed to take into account serial dependence often observed in spatial data. In addition, recent developments, in particular the method of geographically weighted regression, have provided the tools to model non-stationary processes, and thus evidence that challenges the assumption of homogeneity. The assumption of isotropy, however although suspect, has received considerably less attention, and there is thus a need for tools to study anisotropy in a more systematic fashion. In this paper we expand the method of geographically weighted regression in a simple yet effective way to explore the topic of anisotropy in spatial processes. We discuss two different estimation situations and exemplify the proposed technical development by means of a case study.

abstract = {Considerable attention has been paid in recent years to the use and development of local forms of spatial analysis, including the method known as geographically weighted regression (GWR). GWR is a simple, yet conceptually appealing approach for exploring spatial non-stationarity that has been described as a natural evolution of the expansion method. The objective of the present paper is to compare, by means of a simulation exercise, these two local forms of spatial analysis. Motivation for the exercise derives from two basic research questions: Is spatial non-stationarity in GWR an artifact of the way the model is calibrated? And, how well does GWR capture spatial variability? The results suggest that, on average, spatial variability in GWR is not a consequence of the calibration procedure, and that GWR is sufficiently flexible to reproduce the type of map patterns used in the simulation experiment.},

abstract = {Large variability and correlations among the coefficients obtained from the method of geographically weighted regression (GWR) have been identified in previous research. This is an issue that poses a serious challenge for the utility of the method as a tool to investigate multivariate relationships. The objectives of this paper are to assess: (1) the ability of GWR to discriminate between a spatially constant processes and one with spatially varying relationships; and (2) to accurately retrieve spatially varying relationships. Extensive numerical experiments are used to investigate situations where the underlying process is stationary and nonstationary, and to assess the degree to which spurious intercoefficient correlations are introduced. Two different implementations of GWR and cross-validation approaches are assessed. Results suggest that judicious application of GWR can be used to discern whether the underlying process is nonstationary. Furthermore, evidence of spurious correlations indicates that caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions regarding spatial relationships retrieved using this approach, particularly when working with small samples.},
annote = {RQ: How well does LWR discriminate between a spatially constant processes and one with spatially varying relationships and how accurately does LWR estimate spatially varying relationships?

        
Results: Depending on the level of true correlation in variables, estimation (either LWR or Local Linear) and CV approaches (standardized or not), LWR will falsely prescribe non-stationary processes 10\%-50\% of the time. The authors confirm that a "nonnegligible" amount of spatial variation and subsequently correlation between LWR coeff. surfaces is inherently generated by the method. Tendency to overfit. 

        
Contributions: This article contributes to the literature by examining these two issues(stationary/non-stationary discrimination and retrieving reliable parametric surfaces) by considering different estimation/CV techniques not considered previously. 

        
          
Future work: Systematically changing sample sizes, determining a minimum sample size for LWR, introducing varying levels of correlation between coefficient surfaces, as supposed to one fixed rate.

        
This article does not really compare different CV methods.

abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been proposed as a technique to explore spatial parametric nonstationarity. The method has been developed mainly along the lines of local regression and smoothing techniques, a strategy that has led to a number of difficult questions about the regularity conditions of the likelihood function, the effective number of degrees of freedom, and in general the relevance of extending the method to derive inference and model specification tests. In this paper we argue that placing GWR within a different statistical context, as a spatial model of error variance heterogeneity, or what might be termed locational heterogeneity, solves these difficulties. A maximum-likelihood-based framework for estimation and inference of a general geographically weighted regression model is presented that leads to a method to estimate location-specific kernel bandwidths. Moreover, a test for locational heterogeneity is derived and its use exemplified with a case study.},

abstract = {Wildland fire in the South commands considerable attention, given the expanding wildland urban interface (WUI) across the region. Much of this growth is propelled by higher income retirees and others desiring natural amenity residential settings. However, population growth in the WUI increases the likelihood of wildfire fire ignition caused by people, as humans account for 93\% of all wildfires fires in the South. Coexisting with newly arrived, affluent WUI populations are working class, poor or otherwise socially vulnerable populations. The latter groups typically experience greater losses from environmental disasters such as wildfire because lower income residents are less likely to have established mitigation programs in place to help absorb loss. We use geographically weighted regression to examine spatial variation in the association between social vulnerability (SOVUL) and wildfire risk. In doing so, we identify "hot spots" or geographical clusters where SOVUL varies positively with wildfire risk across six Southern states-Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina. These clusters may or may not be located in the WUI. These hot spots are most prevalent in South Carolina and Florida. Identification of these population clusters can aid wildfire managers in deciding which communities to prioritize for mitigation programming.},

In addition, this study intends to advance the statistical methodology of local regression analysis through a case study analyzing predictor variables of American College Test (ACT) score for 447 public high schools in Missouri. A school-level statistical model of ACT score with nine predictor variables relevant to student, teacher, and school characteristics is tested. Ordinary least squares (OLS) global regression analysis derives a model of five predictor variables, showing that schools with higher parent income and education levels, more double-parent family background, larger class size, and more experienced teachers tend to have higher ACT scores. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) local regression analysis is conducted using the five globally verified predictor variables to minimize violations of regression assumptions, particularly multicollinearity, in local models. Geographic distributions of local regression coefficients are examined at a series of local regression neighborhoods to draw integral conclusions of variable effects for local areas. Analyses show that using globally verified predictor variables in GWR effectively avoids multicollinearity that would otherwise appear. The results highlight critical local regression neighborhoods at which certain local areas start to show opposite local variable effects from the global variable effects.},

In this research, high-resolution pan-sharpened IKONOS image, LiDAR data, and parcel data are used to estimate small-area population in the eastern part of the city of Denton, Texas. Residential buildings are extracted through object-based classification techniques supported by shape indices and spectral signatures. Three population indicators building count, building volume and building area at block level are derived using spatial joining and zonal statistics in GIS. Linear regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models generated using the three variables and the census data are used to estimate population at the census block level. The maximum total estimation accuracy that can be attained by the models is 94.21\%. Accuracy assessments suggest that the GWR models outperformed linear regression models due to their better handling of spatial heterogeneity. Models generated from building volume and area gave better results. The models have lower accuracy in both densely populated census blocks and sparsely populated census blocks, which could be partly attributed to the lower accuracy of the LiDAR data used.},

abstract = {Variations in real estate prices within an urban area are commonly exploited to value local amenities. Be they public or private goods, local amenities should be capitalized into property prices. This paper, however, demonstrates that standard hedonic models used to recover implicit prices are highly sensitive to sample choice and to model specification. In the case of Los ANgeles, complex local housing markets produce attribute prices that vary spatially and temporally, violating the common assumption that they are fixed. This misspecification yields estimated average effects of the value of acces to light rail stations that vary widely across seemingly innocuous choices regarding samples and model specification. The paper proposes an alternative, more flexible approach, which yields a finding of no capitalization of light rail access into surrounding home prices.},
annote = {RQ: Since previous, fixed parameter estimates of Los Angeles light rail capitalization into local housing prices are decidely mixed, does using LWR to relax the parameter assumptions result in a more robust estimate of the effect of light rail proximity on housing prices?
        
Results: The paper shows that the estimates of fixed parameter hedonic models of various specifications are not stable, giving conflicting results and vulnerable to omission bias, in this case, access to highway ramps. LWR estimates suggest that there is no capitalization of light rail access into local housing prices, concurrent with the light ridership statistics of the LA Metro.
        
Contribution: Redfearn provides more evidence that previous fixed-parameter hedonic analysis is vulnerable when examining potentially spatially heterogenous variables, and points to LWR as an alternate in its robustness to specification choice and omitted variables.

abstract = {This study analyses the relationship between fire incidence and some environmental factors, exploring the spatial non-stationarity of the phenomenon in sub-Saharan Africa. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to study the above relationship. Environment covariates comprise land cover, anthropogenic and climatic variables. GWR was compared to ordinary least squares, and the hypothesis that GWR represents no improvement over the global model was tested. Local regression coefficients were mapped, interpreted and related with fire incidence. GWR revealed local patterns in parameter estimates and also reduced the spatial autocorrelation of model residuals. All the covariates were non-stationary and in terms of goodness of fit, the model replicates the data very well (R 2=87\%). Vegetation has the most significant relationship with fire incidence, with climate variables being more important than anthropogenic variables in explaining variability of the response. Some coefficient estimates exhibit locally different signs, which would have gone undetected by a global approach. This study provides an improved understanding of spatial fireenvironment relationships and shows that GWR is a valuable complement to global spatial analysis methods. When studying fire regimes, effects of spatial non-stationarity need to be incorporated in vegetation-fire modules to have better estimates of burned areas and to improve continental estimates of biomass burning and atmospheric emissions derived from vegetation fires.},

abstract = {The effective use of spatial information, that is the geographic locations of population units, in a regression model-based approach to small area estimation is an important practical issue. One approach for incorporating such spatial information in a small area regression model is via Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). In GWR the relationship between the outcome variable and the covariates is characterised by local rather than global parameters, where local is defined spatially. In this paper we investigate GWR-based small area estimation under the M-quantile modelling approach. In particular, we specify an M-quantile GWR model that is a local model for the M-quantiles of the conditional distribution of the outcome variable given the covariates. This model is then used to define a bias-robust predictor of the small area characteristic of interest that also accounts for spatial association in the data. An important spin-off from applying the M-quantile GWR small area model is that it can potentially offer more efficient synthetic estimation for out of sample areas. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework through both model-based as well as design-based simulations, with the latter based on a realistic survey data set. The paper concludes with an illustrative application that focuses on estimation of average levels of Acid Neutralizing Capacity for lakes in the north-east of the USA.},

To deal with spatial autocorrelation and unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we contrast two models: a geographically weighted regression model, and a CliffOrd model with spatial lags in the dependent variable, the exogenous variables, and the disturbances as well as submarket fixed effects and an extensive set of covariates. We find that Angelenos like lawns: over 88\% of the properties examined would gain value with additional irrigated grass on their parcel, and even more (89\%) in their neighborhood. Although more non-irrigated grass/bare soil on parcels typically hurts property values, it often has the opposite effect at the neighborhood level. Moreover, additional parcel trees would decrease the value of almost 40\% of the properties examined and they would have only a small positive impact on most of the others. By contrast, additional neighborhood trees would slightly increase the value of over 97\% of the properties analyzed. This suggests that while Los Angeles residents may want additional trees, they are unwilling to pay for them. These results have implications for urban tree planting programs that rely primarily on private property owners.},

The body of work that relies on this approach has tended, in keeping with economics' nomothetic tradition, to assume that local and regional growth factors are constant over space. The focus of this paper is on exploring the spatial stationarity of employment growth factors in Canada, but it also seeks to clarify some of the broad principles behind spatial regression techniques in order to provide a point of entry and a conceptual framework for empirical researchers. To do so, we apply a recently developed technique, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), and we explore the method's advantages and limits for answering our research question. We find evidence that growth factors differ across Canada, but we also conclude that the GWR technique, given the number and shape of regions available for our analysis and given certain limitations that are currently inherent to the method, can only provide tentative and exploratory results.},

abstract = {In the framework of the geographically weighted regression technique, spatial homoscedasticity of the model error term is a common assumption when a spatially varying coefficient model is calibrated to explore spatial nonstationarity of the regression relationship. In many real-world problems, however, this assumption cannot be guaranteed. In this study we first present a residual-based test method for detecting spatial heteroscedasticity of a spatially varying coefficient model. Then, we suggest a local linear smoothing procedure to estimate the variance function of the model error when heteroscedasticity exists, on which a reweighting estimation of the regression coefficients is derived. Some numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the test and the gain in accuracy of the coefficient estimates by using the reweighting estimation method. The results demonstrate that the test method is powerful and that the reweighting estimation can improve the accuracy of the coefficient estimates, especially when strong heteroscedasticity exists in the model error term. Finally, a real-world dataset is analyzed to demonstrate the applications of the proposed test and estimation methods.},

abstract = {We use a geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach to examine how the relationships between a set of predictors and prenatal care vary across the continental US. At its most fundamental, GWR is an exploratory technique that can facilitate the identification of areas with low prenatal care utilization and help better understand which predictors are associated with prenatal care at specific locations. Our work complements existing prenatal care research in providing an ecological, place-sensitive analysis. We found that the percent of the population who was uninsured was positively associated with the percent of women receiving late or no prenatal care in the global model. The GWR map not only confirmed, but also demonstrated the spatial varying association. Additionally, we found that the number of Ob-Gyn doctors per 100,000 females of childbearing age in a county was associated with the percentage of women receiving late or no prenatal care, and that a higher value of female disadvantage is associated with higher percentages of late or no prenatal care. GWR offers a more nuanced examination of prenatal care and provides empirical evidence in support of locally tailored health policy formation and program implementation, which may improve program effectiveness.},

abstract = {In quantitative geography, there have been a large number of major changes within the past decade. These changes often do not necessarily represent the development of new techniques, but they rather reflect general methodological changes, i.e. how quantitative methods are approached and their results interpreted. A much greater emphasis is given to the development of new techniques for spatial analysis which do not conform to the traditional statistical ways of thinking. For example, emphasis is put on exploratory spatial data analysis, GIS-based forms of spatial analysis, methods of local analysis, visualizing data and model outputs. It is focused primarily on spatial data analysis as a part of geographical research, because spatial data have unique qualities which make the use of methods borrowed from non-spatial disciplines highly questionable. The article deals with one of the new quantitative methods used in geography geographically weighted regression (GWR). GWR is a method of analysing spatially varying relationships which completely corresponds to the contemporary development in quantitative analysis used in geography. GWR is described first by reviewing the basic methodological framework including some of the related issues, and second by presenting an empirical example of application. GWR is based on the premise that relationships between variables might not be constant across the study area. In traditional regression analysis, it is assumed that the modelled relationship exists everywhere in the study area - i.e. the regression parameters are fixed over space. In many situations this is not necessarily the case, as mapping of residuals may reveal. This phenomenon called spatial non-stationarity is one of the major geographical analytical issues and GWR is a technique for exploring it. The advantage of GWR is that it is based on the traditional and well-known regression framework. Estimation of parameters is done through implementation of a geographical weighting scheme that is organised in a way that observation nearer the point in space where the parameter estimates is given has a heavier weight in the model than data further away. The resulting regression parameter estimates may be mapped in order to examine local variations and tested for significant spatial non-stationarity. The empirical quantitative analyses in this article are based on aggregate statistical data referring to voting behaviour in Czechia in the parliamentary election in 2002. First, global multiple linear regression is applied to explore relationships between electoral results of two political parties (ODS and KSCM) and other selected socio-economic variables at municipality level. Second, GWR model is employed for the same input variables in view to proceed to comparative analysis. Although global regression models show some interesting and significant results, they have a shortcoming that they can mask geographical variations in studied relationships. GWR as a method of local analysis explores inaccuracy of global regression models. Empirical examples highlight the relevance and usefulness of GWR and show how it can improve our understanding of geographical processes. Fig. 1 - A spatial kernel.

abstract = {Scientific interpretation of the relationships between agricultural landscape patterns and urbanization is important for ecological planning and management. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is the primary statistical method in previous studies. However, this global regression lacks the ability to uncover some local-specific relationships and spatial autocorrelation in model residuals. This study employed geographically weighted regression (GWR) to examine the spatially varying relationships between several urbanization indicators (urbanization intensity index, distance to urban centers and distance to road) and changes in metrics describing agricultural landscape patterns (total area, patch density, perimeter area ratio distribution and aggregation index) at two block scales (5 km and 10 km). Results denoted that GWR was more powerful than OLS in interpreting relationships between agricul- tural landscape patterns and urbanization, since GWR was characterized by higher adjust R2, lower Akaike Information Criterion values and reduced spatial autocorrelations in model residuals. Character and strength of the relationships identified by GWR varied spatially. In addition, GWR results were scale- dependent and scale effects were particularly significant in three aspects: kernel bandwidth of weight determination, block scale of pattern analysis, and window size of local variance analysis. Homogeneity and heterogeneity in the relationships between agricultural landscape patterns and urbanization were subject to the coupled influences of the three scale effects. We argue that the spatially varying rela- tionships between agricultural landscape patterns and urbanization are not accidental but nearly universal. This study demonstrated that GWR has the potential to provide references for ecological planners and managers to address agricultural landscapes issues at all scales.},

Result/Answer: Housing regulation has a strong positive effect on Soutern California housing prices. The GCV score is much smaller, suggesting that previous estimates made inappropriate assumptions in aggregating the data.
        
Contribution to field: Compared to previous estimates, LWR relaxes restrictive assumptions that have led to biased estimates of the regulatory "shadow cost" in the past.

Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was applied to model the possible pollution impact of old industrial sites on colon and lung cancer incidents. GWR is a local spatial statistical model analyzing the relations of non-stationary factors across the space. It generates a separate spatially-weighted least square regression for each of the observations across the study area. The results shows that the high density clusters of the old industrial sites occur in the large urban areas of New York City, Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse, and Albany. GWR modeling indicates that high local R2 coincides with moderate cancer mortality incidents. The overall GWR predictions are satisfactory as the R2 of colon cancer is 0.8848 and that of lung cancer is 0.8755. However, AICc values are large for both types of cancer predictions.},

abstract = {The extent to which urban tree cover influences crime is in debate in the literature. This research took advantage of geocoded crime point data and high resolution tree canopy data to address this question in Baltimore City and County, MD, an area that includes a significant urbanrural gradient. Using ordinary least squares and spatially adjusted regression and controlling for numerous potential confounders, we found that there is a strong inverse relationship between tree canopy and our index of robbery, burglary, theft and shooting. The more conservative spatially adjusted model indicated that a 10\% increase in tree canopy was associated with a roughly 12\% decrease in crime. When we broke down tree cover by public and private ownership for the spatial model, we found that the inverse relationship continued in both contexts, but the magnitude was 40\% greater for public than for private lands. We also used geographically weighted regression to identify spatial non-stationarity in this relationship, which we found for trees in general and trees on private land, but not for trees on public land. Geographic plots of pseudo-t statistics indicated that while there was a negative relationship between crime and trees in the vast majority of block groups of the study area, there were a few patches where the opposite relationship was true, particularly in a part of Baltimore City where there is an extensive interface between industrial and residential properties. It is possible that in this area a significant proportion of trees is growing in abandoned lands between these two land uses.},

These results, coupled with measurements of spatial correlation, reveal the importance of spatial analysis in the study of the interaction of alcohol and violence. While studies increasingly incorporate spatial correlation among model residuals to improve precision and reduce bias, to date, most analyses assume associations that are constant and independent of location, an assumption coming under increasing scrutiny in the quantitative geography literature. In this paper, we review and contrast two approaches for the estimation of and inference for spatially heterogeneous effects (i.e., associative factors whose impacts on the outcome of interest vary throughout geographic space). Specifically, we provide an in-depth comparison of "geographically weighted regression" models (allowing covariate effects to vary in space but only allowing relatively ad hoc inference) with "variable coefficient" models (allowing varying effects via spatial random fields and providing model-based estimation and inference, but requiring more advanced computational techniques). We compare the approaches with respect to underlying conceptual structures, computational implementation, and inferential output. We apply both approaches to violent crime, illegal drug arrest, and alcohol distribution data from Houston, Texas and compare results in light of the differing methodological structures of the two approaches.},

In this method a spatially varying coefficient model is locally calibrated and the spatial-variation patterns of the locally estimated regression coefficients are taken as the main evidence of spatial nonstationarity for the underlying data-generating processes. Therefore, the validity of the analysis results drawn by GWR is closely dependent on the accuracy between the underlying coefficients and their estimates. Motivated by the local polynomial-modelling technique in statistics, we propose a local linear-based GWR for the spatially varying coefficient models, in which the coefficients are locally expanded as linear functions of the spatial coordinates and then estimated by the weighted least-squares procedure. Some theoretical and numerical comparisons with GWR are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve GWR, not only in goodness-of-fit of the whole regression function but also in reducing bias of the coefficient estimates.},

abstract = {Visualizing and interpreting output from spatially varying coefficient models, such as geographically weighted regression (GWR), can be challenging, given the amount of information the models provide the spatial analyst. Adding to the visualization dilemma are various diagnostic tools for checking the coherence of the model. One such diagnostic tool is based on decomposing the regression coefficient variance matrix to test for collinearity, which is relevant because previous research has shown that collinearity can lead to estimated regression coefficients for multiple regression terms that are strongly correlated with each other. In this paper, I present visualization tools, such as linked scatter plots, parallel coordinate plots, and maps, for diagnosing correlation in estimated regression coefficients that can be problematic for statistical inference on relationships between variables. These tools help explain patterns of dependence between regression terms apparent in scatter plots of estimated coefficients and link the structure in the scatter plots to locational information in a map. Visualization of this information should aid in the typical spatially varying coefficient model estimation process. I apply the methodological approaches to model census undercount in Franklin County, Ohio.},

In addition, we focus on the inherent coefficient shrinkage properties of the Bayesian SVCP model as a way to address increased coefficient variance that follows from collinearity in GWR models. We outline the advantages of the Bayesian model in terms of reducing inflated coefficient variance, enhanced model flexibility, and more formal measuring of model uncertainty for prediction. We find spatially varying effects for alcohol outlets and drug violations, but the amount of variation depends on the type of model used. For the Bayesian model, this variation is controllable through the amount of prior influence placed on the variance of the coefficients. For example, the spatial pattern of coefficients is similar for the GWR and Bayesian models when a relatively large prior variance is used in the Bayesian model.},

abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is drawing attention as a statistical method to estimate regression models with spatially varying relationships between explanatory variables and a response variable. Local collinearity in weighted explanatory variables leads to GWR coefficient estimates that are correlated locally and across space, have inflated variances, and are at times counterintuitive and contradictory in sign to the global regression estimates. The presence of local collinearity in the absence of global collinearity necessitates the use of diagnostic tools in the local regression model building process to highlight areas in which the results are not reliable for statistical inference. The method of ridge regression can also be integrated into the GWR framework to constrain and stabilize regression coefficients and lower prediction error. This paper presents numerous diagnostic tools and ridge regression in GWR and demonstrates the utility of these techniques with an example using the Columbus crime dataset.},

abstract = {The realization in the statistical and geographical sciences that a relationship between an explanatory variable and a response variable in a linear regression model is not always constant across a study area has led to the development of regression models that allow for spatially varying coefficients. Two competing models of this type are geographically weighted regression (GWR) and Bayesian regression models with spatially varying coefficient processes (SVCP). In the application of these spatially varying coefficient models, marginal inference on the regression coefficient spatial processes is typically of primary interest. In light of this fact, there is a need to assess the validity of such marginal inferences, since these inferences may be misleading in the presence of explanatory variable collinearity. In this paper, we present the results of a simulation study designed to evaluate the sensitivity of the spatially varying coefficients in the competing models to various levels of collinearity. The simulation study results show that the Bayesian regression model produces more accurate inferences on the regression coefficients than does GWR. In addition, the Bayesian regression model is overall fairly robust in terms of marginal coefficient inference to moderate levels of collinearity, and degrades less substantially than GWR with strong collinearity.},

abstract = {Present methodological research on geographically weighted regression (GWR) focuses primarily on extensions of the basic GWR model, while ignoring well-established diagnostics tests commonly used in standard global regression analysis. This paper investigates multicollinearity issues surrounding the local GWR coefficients at a single location and the overall correlation between GWR coefficients associated with two different exogenous variables. Results indicate that the local regression coefficients are potentially collinear even if the underlying exogenous variables in the data generating process are uncorrelated. Based on these findings, applied GWR research should practice caution in substantively interpreting the spatial patterns of local GWR coefficients. An empirical disease-mapping example is used to motivate the GWR multicollinearity problem. Controlled experiments are performed to systematically explore coefficient dependency issues in GWR. These experiments specify global models that use eigenvectors from a spatial link matrix as exogenous variables.},

GWR depicts spatial patterns. This paper examines the pattern of height and crude death rate in the United States prior to the Civil War by this method. The GWR results show that access to water transportation increased mortality and decreased stature in the food exporting areas of the Midwest, and the opposite pattern appeared in the food importing areas of the Northeast.},

From the 2003 Master Property (MPROP) data file of the City of Milwaukee, a set of owner-occupied single family houses were randomly selected (representing 99\% of confidence within a 2\% range of accuracy of the total population) to model how house values are related to various house attributes. Remote sensing information (the fraction of soil and impervious surface that represent degraded neighborhood environmental conditions) is added to fine-tune the relationship. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach is used to investigate spatial non-stationarity. The modeling revealed that significant spatial non-stationarity existed between house values and the predictors. Specifically, the study found that those house attributes-including floor size, number of bathrooms, air conditioners, and fireplaces-add more value to houses in the more affluent areas (especially on the east side near Lake Michigan and in suburban areas) than in the relatively poor areas. In addition, older houses in the historical area are more expensive, which differs from other areas. Environmental conditions, though expected to have a negative impact on house values in most areas, did not affect house values in the historical area.},

abstract = {The principal rationale for applying geographically weighted regression (GWR) techniques is to investigate the potential spatial non-stationarity of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables-i.e.,that the same stimulus would provoke different responses in different locations. The calibration of GWR employs a geographically weighted local least squares regression approach. To obtain meaningful inference, it assumes that the regression residual follows a normal or asymptotically normal distribution. In many classical econometric analyses, the assumption of normality is often readily relaxed, although it has been observed that such relaxation might lead to unreliable inference of the estimated coefficients' statistical significance. No studies, however, have examined the behavior of residual non-normality and its consequences for the modeled relationships in GWR. This study attempts to address this issue for the first time by examining a set of tobacco-outlet-density and demographic variables (i.e., percent African American residents, percent Hispanic residents, and median household income) at the census tract level in New Jersey in a GWR analysis. The regression residual using the raw data is apparently non-normal. When GWR is estimated using the raw data, we find that there is no significant spatial variation of the coefficients between tobacco outlet density and percentage of African American and Hispanics. After transforming the dependent variable and making the residual asymptotically normal, all coefficients exhibit significant variation across space. This finding suggests that relaxation of the normality assumption could potentially conceal the spatial non-stationarity of the modeled relationships in GWR. The empirical evidence of the current study implies that researchers should verify the normality assumption prior to applying GWR techniques in analyses of spatial non-stationarity.},

abstract = {The geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been widely applied to many practical fields for exploring spatial non-stationarity of a regression relationship. However, this method is inherently not robust to outliers due to the least squares criterion in the process of estimation. Outliers commonly exist in data sets and may lead to a distorted estimate of the underlying regression relationship. Using the least absolute deviation criterion, we propose two robust scenarios of the GWR approaches to handle outliers. One is based on the basic GWR and the other is based on the local linear GWR (LGWR). The proposed methods can automatically reduce the impact of outliers on the estimates of the regression coefficients and can be easily implemented with modern computer software for dealing with the linear programming problems.We then conduct simulations to assess the perfor- mance of the proposed methods and the results demonstrate that the methods are quite robust to outliers and can retrieve the underlying coefficient surfaces satisfactorily even though the data are seriously contaminated or contain severe outliers.},

abstract = {In recent years alternative modeling techniques have been used to account for spatial autocorrelations among data observations. They include linear mixed model (LMM), generalized additive model (GAM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Previous studies show these models are robust to the violation of model assumptions and flexible to nonlinear relationships among variables. However, many of them are non-spatial in nature. In this study, we utilize a local spatial analysis method (i.e., local Moran coefficient) to investigate spatial distribution and heterogeneity in model residuals from those modeling techniques with ordinary least-squares (OLS) as the benchmark. The regression model used in this study has tree crown area as the response variable, and tree diameter and the coordinates of tree locations as the predictor variables. The results indicate that LMM, GAM, MLP and RBF may improve model fitting to the data and provide better predictions for the response variable, but they generate spatial patterns for model residuals similar to OLS. The OLS, LMM, GAM, MLP and RBF models yield more residual clusters of similar values, indicating that trees in some sub-areas are either all underestimated or all overestimated for the response variable. In contrast, GWR estimates model coefficients at each location in the study area, and produces more accurate predictions for the response variable. Furthermore, the residuals of the GWR model have more desirable spatial distributions than the ones derived from the OLS, LMM, GAM, MLP and RBF models. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
