Rather than just looking at the bandwidths selected, researchers are probably more interested in the accuracy of the model predictions, specifically with regard to the model coefficients. In particular, does LWR tend to overfit the data by choosing small bandwidths and spurious coefficients? In this section we compare the estimated model coefficients to the true model coefficients to better understand the reliability of the LWR procedure.
