abstract = {The application of geographically weighted regression (GWR) – a local spatial statistical technique used to test for spatial nonstationarity – has grown rapidly in the social, health and demographic sciences. GWR is a useful exploratory analytical tool that generates a set of location-specific parameter estimates which can be mapped and analysed to provide information on spatial nonstationarity in relationships between predictors and the outcome variable. A major challenge to GWR users, however, is how best to map these parameter estimates. This paper introduces a simple mapping technique that combines local parameter estimates and local t-values on one map. The resultant map can facilitate the exploration and interpretation of nonstationarity.},

abstract = {Large variability and correlations among the coefficients obtained from the method of geographically weighted regression (GWR) have been identified in previous research. This is an issue that poses a serious challenge for the utility of the method as a tool to investigate multivariate relationships. The objectives of this paper are to assess: (1) the ability of GWR to discriminate between a spatially constant processes and one with spatially varying relationships; and (2) to accurately retrieve spatially varying relationships. Extensive numerical experiments are used to investigate situations where the underlying process is stationary and nonstationary, and to assess the degree to which spurious intercoefficient correlations are introduced. Two different implementations of GWR and cross-validation approaches are assessed. Results suggest that judicious application of GWR can be used to discern whether the underlying process is nonstationary. Furthermore, evidence of spurious correlations indicates that caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions regarding spatial relationships retrieved using this approach, particularly when working with small samples. Keywords: GWR, correlation, locally linear estimation, simulation, goodness of fit, inference},
annote = {RQ: How well does LWR discriminate between a spatially constant processes and one with spatially varying relationships and how accurately does LWR estimate spatially varying relationships?
        
Results: Depending on the level of true correlation in variables, estimation (either LWR or Local Linear) and CV approaches (standardized or not), LWR will falsely prescribe non-stationary processes 10\%-50\% of the time. The authors confirm that a "nonnegligible" amount of spatial variation and subsequently correlation between LWR coeff. surfaces is inherently generated by the method. Tendency to overfit. 
        
Contributions: This article contributes to the literature by examining these two issues(stationary/non-stationary discrimination and retrieving reliable parametric surfaces) by considering different estimation/CV techniques not considered previously. 
                  
Future work: Systematically changing sample sizes, determining a minimum sample size for LWR, introducing varying levels of correlation between coefficient surfaces, as supposed to one fixed rate.

Result/Answer: Housing regulation has a strong positive effect on Soutern California housing prices. The GCV score is much smaller, suggesting that previous estimates made inappropriate assumptions in aggregating the data.
        
Contribution to field: Compared to previous estimates, LWR relaxes restrictive assumptions that have led to biased estimates of the regulatory "shadow cost" in the past.

This paper investigates multicollinearity issues surrounding the local GWR coefficients at a single location and the overall correlation between GWR coefficients associated with two different exogenous variables. Results indicate that the local regression coefficients are potentially collinear even if the underlying exogenous variables in the data generating process are uncorrelated. Based on these findings, applied GWR research should practice caution in substantively interpreting the spatial patterns of local GWR coefficients. An empirical disease-mapping example is used to motivate the GWR multicollinearity problem. Controlled experiments are performed to systematically explore coefficient dependency issues in GWR. These experiments specify global models that use eigenvectors from a spatial link matrix as exogenous variables.},

abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is drawing attention as a statistical method to estimate regression models with spatially varying relationships between explanatory variables and a response variable. Local collinearity in weighted explanatory variables leads to GWR coefficient estimates that are correlated locally and across space, have inflated variances, and are at times counterintuitive and contradictory in sign to the global regression estimates. The presence of local collinearity in the absence of global collinearity necessitates the use of diagnostic tools in the local regression model building process to highlight areas in which the results are not reliable for statistical inference. The method of ridge regression can also be integrated into the GWR framework to constrain and stabilize regression coefficients and lower prediction error. This paper presents numerous diagnostic tools and ridge regression in GWR and demonstrates the utility of these techniques with an example using the Columbus crime dataset.},

A distance-decay function allows identification of the range of distance over which open space affects housing values and the estimation of a proxy for the value added to nearby houses resulting from hypothetical open space preservation. Ex post analyses of the open-space regression coefficients suggest marginal implicit price functions for three types of open space that decay as open space area increases with respect to house location.},

Results: The authors find that as the area of open space increases for larger buffer radii, the effect on housing price is significant and decreases, approaching 0 after radii of 2.2, 1.5, and 0.8 miles for developed open space, forest-land open space, and agriculture-wetland open space, respectively.
        
Contribution:Accurately estimating the distance decay functional relationships for a community may be useful to local planners and policy makers for planning future communal open spaces, and potential tax revenue from open space preservation at a target site for local governments

The findings show that the value of proximity to greenways, parks, and water bodies increased over time, while the value of lot size and proximity to golf cources fell. Proximity to open space is found to be a substitute for lot size, although the degree of substitutionalibility has eakened over time. Geographic variation in the marginal effects of lot size and proximity to open space is analyzed using LWR analysis.},
annote = {RQ: How does lot size and proximity to different kinds of open spaces (golf courses, parks, bodies of water, greenways) effect housing prices in Knox Cty, Tennessee, and does the effect vary both spatially and temporally?
        
Results: Moving 1,000 feet closer to open spaces from the mean distance results in almost universally higher housing prices, usually an increase of between \$165 and \$1,850, but the magnitude of the effect varies both geographically and temporally, depending on the quality of the open space and population density. The results are almost all statistically significant at the 5\% level. A 1000 sq ft increase in lot size from the mean also positively affects housing price by between \$100-\$750, depending on the time period and region. The effect of decreased density decreased over the 2 time periods.
        
Contribution: Cho, et al, uses LWR on data from a single TN county for both spatial and temporal hedonic housing price analysis. The variance in price effects of both lot size and open space proximity captured by the model will be helpful for land use planners, according to the authors. 
        
Data: Pertains to Knox County, TN. Utilized 4 primary GIS data sets: boundary data (Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission), environmental feature data (Knoxville Utilities Board Geographic Informantion System (KGIS)), census-block group data (GeoLytics, a private data provider) , and individual residential data (KGIS and Knox County Tax Assessor's Office). 
Data is for single family homes sold between 1989-1991 and 1999-2001.
        
Methodology/Evidence: First determined via a likelihood ratio (LR) test that the data set should be seperated temporally and regressed seperately as supposed to being pooled. Compared the LWR model results to an OLS regression, found that LWR has higher adj. R-squared values, lower RSS, and F-values that confirm that the local models are a better fit than the global models for both time periods. Also tested for autocorrelation via I-values, and finds that the local model partially but not adequately addresses the AC found in the global models.
        
Future work: Since LWR failed to adequately address spatial autocorrelation in the data, incomplete/misspecification of the model cannot be ruled out, and so further research into spatial dynamics of the housing market is needed.
        
Questions/Comments: In your article, you mention that since LWR smooths parameter changes, it might be inaccurate when dealing with parameter jumps that could occur when moving beweteen neighborhoods. This could also be a concern here, and might have to do with the AC problem?

abstract = {Increasingly, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is being used for spatial prediction rather than for inference. Our study compares GWR as a predictor to (a) its global counterpart of multiple linear regression (MLR); (b) traditional geostatistical models such as ordinary kriging (OK) and universal kriging (UK), with MLR as a mean component; and (c) hybrids, where kriging models are specified with GWR as a mean component. For this purpose, we test the performance of each model on data simulated with differing levels of spatial heterogeneity (with respect to data relationships in the mean process) and spatial autocorrelation (in the residual process). Our results demonstrate that kriging (in a UK form) should be the preferred predictor, reflecting its optimal statistical properties. However the GWR-kriging hybrids perform with merit and, as such, a predictor of this form may provide a worthy alternative to UK for particular (non-stationary relationship) situations when UK models cannot be reliably calibrated. GWR predictors tend to perform more poorly than their more complex GWR-kriging counterparts, but both GWR-based models are useful in that they provide extra information on the spatial processes generating the data that are being predicted.},

The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regeression: (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions: (c) several graphical moethods that are useful tools for understanding loess eestimates and checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is based: and (d) the M plot, an adaptation of Mallow's C(p) procedure, which provides a graphical portrayal of the trade-off between variance and bias, and which can be used to choose the amount of smoothing.},

@article{Wheeler2008,
abstract = {In the field of spatial analysis, the interest of some researchers in modeling relationships between variables locally has led to the development of regression models with spatially varying coefficients. One such model that has been widely applied is geographically weighted regression (GWR). In the application of GWR, marginal inference on the spatial pattern of regression coefficients is often of interest, as is, less typically, prediction and estimation of the response variable. Empirical research and simulation studies have demonstrated that local correlation in explanatory variables can lead to estimated regression coefficients in GWR that are strongly correlated and, hence, problematic for inference on relationships between variables. The author introduces a penalized form of GWR, called the ‘geographically weighted lasso’ (GWL) which adds a constraint on the magnitude of the estimated regression coefficients to limit the effects of explanatory-variable correlation. The GWL also performs local model selection by potentially shrinking some of the estimated regression coefficients to zero in some locations of the study area. Two versions of the GWL are introduced: one designed to improve prediction of the response variable, and one more oriented toward constraining regression coefficients for inference. The results of applying the GWL to simulated and real datasets show that this method stabilizes regression coefficients in the presence of collinearity and produces lower prediction and estimation error of the response variable than does GWR and another constrained version of GWR—geographically weighted ridge regression.},

Despite these advantages, nonparametric procedures are still not used extensively for spatial data analysis due to perceived difficulties associated with estimation and hypothesis testing. We demonstrate that nonparametric estimation is feasible for large datasets with many independent variables, offering statistical tests of individual covariates and tests of model specification. We show that fixed parameterizatiomn of distance to the nearest rapid transit line is a misspecification and that pricing of access to this amenity varies across neighborhoods within Chicago.},
annote = {RQ: Is the use of LWR in an hedonic analysis of spatial data feasible, and does it accurately describe hedonic house price function compared to fixed parametric spatial models in the context of Monte Carlo procedure and Chicago housing price hedonic analysis?
        
Results: The Monte Carlo procedure shows that LWR conserves on DoF and achieves a high level of predictive accuracy compared to fully nonparametric estimation. The hedonic analysis yields geographically varying estimates of the price of EL access, suggesting that fixed parameter estimates are less accurate/misspecified
        
Contribution: Redfearn and McMillen demonstrate the usefulness of LWR through a Monte Carlo procedure, and show that fixed parameter hedonic estimates of EL accessability mask geographical variance, which a LWR picks up on. 
        
Data: Generated data sets in order to perform Monte Carlo procedure, one with a continuously declining dependent variable with distance from the city center and one with irregular "neighborhoods" that introduce shifts in the values.
For the hedonic estimate, a data set of 3,705 observations of Chicago single-family home sales in 2000 within 1 mile of Chicago's elevated train (EL) was used. Assessor's data was used to obtain standard housing characteristics like lot size, \# of rooms, etc. 
        
Methodology: The Monte Carlo procedure was performed with a smoothly changing spatial dependent variable and one with shifts, representing neighborhoods. A third procedure was performed with proxied fixed effects and slope interactions, to introduce some error/uncertainty and more accurately reflect the real world, where researchers will not have perfect knowledge of neighborhood boundaries. 
In the hedonic estimate of the component of EL proximity as in single-family housing prices, the authors first performed a global OWL linear regression that, in its final form, resulted in statistically insignificant results for distance from El stop, thanks to the geographic noise from the data. LWR was then used, both with a 25\% window size and a 100\% window size, with both nonparametric and semi-parametric estimates. 
        
Evidence: The authors state that a large window needs to be used for locational variables, like distance to nearest EL stop, in order to measure the marginal effects, and with a window size of 100\%, find that prices decline by almost 17\% per additional mile from the nearest EL stop. For a 25\% window, the spatial pattern of the coefficients shows information that a simple OLS would simply mask because of data aggregation. The authors provide additional evidence for the strength of LWR by withholding 400 random observations from their data set and using the rest of data set to "predict" the holdouts. RSME for the LWR was much lower than the OLS, and while OLS with census tract fixed effects had a slightly lower RSME than LWR, LWR used only 1/3 the degrees of freedom. 
        
Future Work: While the authors seek to introduce LWR as a new and powerful tool, it is not the single "best" approach, and thus there might be other ways that provide accurate alternatives that should be examined.

abstract = {This study aims to extend the understanding of regional development mechanisms in China. This study investigates spatial non-stationarity in China’s regional development mechanisms by applying geographically weighted techniques on spatial datasets in the Greater Beijing Area, China. The analyses reveal two results: first, regional development mechanisms in the Greater Beijing Area show significant spatial non-stationarity; and second, development mechanisms have strong local characteristics; this study hence complements the current literature in China’s regional development studies. The study demonstrates the importance of local spatial modeling techniques in regional development research.},

abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) has been proposed as a technique to explore spatial parametric nonstationarity. The method has been developed mainly along the lines of local regression and smoothing techniques, a strategy that has led to a number of difficult questions about the regularity conditions of the likelihood function, the effective number of degrees of freedom, and in general the relevance of extending the method to derive inference and model specification tests. In this paper we argue that placing GWR within a different statistical context, as a spatial model of error variance heterogeneity, or what might be termed locational heterogeneity, solves these difficulties. A maximum-likelihood-based framework for estimation and inference of a general geographically weighted regression model is presented that leads to a method to estimate location-specific kernel bandwidths. Moreover, a test for locational heterogeneity is derived and its use exemplified with a case study.},

abstract = {We use hedonic analysis of home transaction data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area to estimate the effects of proximity to open space on sales price. We allow the effects of proximity to vary with deomgraphic and location-specific characteristics and include fixed effects to control for observed and unobserved neighborhood characteristics. We find that the value of proximity to open space is higher in neighborhoods that are dense, near the central business district, high-income, high-crime, or home to many children. Using the metropolitan area's average value may substantially overestimate or underestimate the value of open space in particular neighborhoods.},
annote = {RQ: Using home transaction data from the Twin Cities area, what demographic, spatial, and eocnomic factors determine the amenity value of open space in urban housing markets, and how do they vary across neighborhoods?
        
Results: In the Twin Cities area, the effect of open space on housing prices depends on location and neighborhood characteristics. Denser, higher-income neighborhoods "pay" much more for parks than less dense, poorer neighborhoods. Secondly, not controlling for unobserved neighborhood characteristics can lead to biased estimates for observed characteristics.
        
Contribution: This study uses a larger data set of more homes in a larger geographical area, and examines how proximity effects vary with more factors than any other known previous studies. In short, this is a more comprehensive and thorough hedonic analysis than any predecessors known to the authors. },

abstract = {This article compares results from non-spatial and new spatial methods to examine the reliability of welfare estimates (direct and multiplier effects) for locational housing attributes in Seattle, WA. In particular, we assess if OLS with spatial fixed effects is able to account for the spatial structure in a way that represents a viable alternative to spatial econometric methods. We find that while OLS with spatial fixed effects accounts for more of the spatial structure than simple OLS, it does not account for all of the spatial structure. It thus does not present a viable alternative to the spatial methods. Similar to existing comparisons between results from non-spatial and established spatial methods, we also find that OLS generates higher coefficient and direct effect estimates for both structural and locational housing characteristics than spatial methods do. OLS with spatial fixed effects is closer to the spatial estimates than OLS without fixed effects but remains higher. Finally, a comparison of the direct effects with locally weighted regression results highlights spatial threshold effects that are missed in the global models. Differences between spatial estimators are almost negligible in this study.},

@article{Clapp2006,
abstract = {Residential neighborhoods are defined as convex geographical areas containing similar populations and roughly homogeneous housing markets. Neighborhoods are relevant largely because confidentiality requires spatial aggregation of data collected at the household level. A hedonic model using individual sales transactions and their street addresses is combined with CART (Classification and Regression Trees) to define the optimal number of neighborhoods and to place neighborhood boundaries in one Connecticut town. There are about half the number of CART neighborhoods than there are census tracts. Moreover, the CART boundaries typically run behind the houses rather than down the middle of the street, and they reduce residual variation. The CART model is important to the submarkets literature, which aggregates neighborhoods into larger homogeneous markets. Moreover, anisotropic spatial autocorrelation can be modeled with CART neighborhoods.},

@article{Wheeler2007a,
abstract = {The realization in the statistical and geographical sciences that a relationship between an explanatory variable and a response variable in a linear regression model is not always constant across a study area has led to the development of regression models that allow for spatially varying coefficients. Two competing models of this type are geographically weighted regression (GWR) and Bayesian regression models with spatially varying coefficient processes (SVCP). In the application of these spatially varying coefficient models, marginal inference on the regression coefficient spatial processes is typically of primary interest. In light of this fact, there is a need to assess the validity of such marginal inferences, since these inferences may be misleading in the presence of explanatory variable collinearity. In this paper, we present the results of a simulation study designed to evaluate the sensitivity of the spatially varying coefficients in the competing models to various levels of collinearity. The simulation study results show that the Bayesian regression model produces more accurate inferences on the regression coefficients than does GWR. In addition, the Bayesian regression model is overall fairly robust in terms of marginal coefficient inference to moderate levels of collinearity, and degrades less substantially than GWR with strong collinearity.},

@article{Redfearn2009c,
abstract = {Variations in real estate prices within an urban area are commonly exploited to value local amenities. Be they public or private goods, local amenities should be capitalized into property prices. This paper, however, demonstrates that standard hedonic models used to recover implicit prices are highly sensitive to sample choice and to model specification. In the case of Los ANgeles, complex local housing markets produce attribute prices that vary spatially and temporally, violating the common assumption that they are fixed. This misspecification yields estimated average effects of the value of acces to light rail stations that vary widely across seemingly innocuous choices regarding samples and model specification. The paper proposes an alternative, more flexible approach, which yields a finding of no capitalization of light rail access into surrounding home prices.},
annote = {RQ: Since previous, fixed parameter estimates of Los Angeles light rail capitalization into local housing prices are decidely mixed, does using LWR to relax the parameter assumptions result in a more robust estimate of the effect of light rail proximity on housing prices?
        
Results: The paper shows that the estimates of fixed parameter hedonic models of various specifications are not stable, giving conflicting results and vulnerable to omission bias, in this case, access to highway ramps. LWR estimates suggest that there is no capitalization of light rail access into local housing prices, concurrent with the light ridership statistics of the LA Metro.
        
Contribution: Redfearn provides more evidence that previous fixed-parameter hedonic analysis is vulnerable when examining potentially spatially heterogenous variables, and points to LWR as an alternate in its robustness to specification choice and omitted variables.

abstract = {In geographically weighted regression, one must determine a window size which will be used to subset the data locally. Typically, a cross-validation procedure is used to determine a globally optimal window size. Preliminary investigations indicate that the global cross-validation score is heavily influenced by a small number of observations in the dataset. At present, the ramifications of this behaviour in cross-validation are unknown. The research reported here explores the extent to which individual and groups of observations impact optimal window size determination, and whether one can explain why some points are more influential than others. In addition, we strive to examine the impact neighbourhood specifi- cation has on model quality in terms of predictive capabilities and the ability of the method to retrieve spatially varying processes. The analysis is based on several datasets and using simulated data in order to compare and validate results. The results provide some practical guidelines for the use of cross-validation.},

Results: The authors reveal that depending on the dependent variable values, certain observations do influence CVS more than others, and propose 3 methods of smoothing the disproportionate influence of said observations that they then apply to 3 empirical datasets as well as a Monte Carlo simulation.
        
Contribution: While it is a technical paper, the authors intend to education the reader on the limitations of using CV, and the advantages and disadvantages of using the 3 correctional methods.
                  
They choose row standardization over the other 2 methods b/c they are interested in eliminating undue influence of certain observations in det optimal bandwidth based on CV minimization, and RowStan. has the lowest polarization score, a measure of how influential certain observations have on determining total CV.
