To Do
========================================================

This is a place to keep track of future ideas, concerns, and tasks that need to be thought about/taken care of.


* Email Paez about the equation for the row standardized CV score. Is it a typo in the article?
* Figure out a different system for ``knitting'' together the document and code.
  * How do I set options globally? 
    * width of R output?
    * tidy = FALSE
    * echo = FALSE
    * where are figures and where should they go?
  * should I have separate scripts for analysis and big figures?
  * how do I reference a tikZ figure?
* How do I include citations in my knitR document?
